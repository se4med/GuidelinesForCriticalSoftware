## Guidelines for the development of a critical software under emergency

During the COVID-19 pandemic, around the middle of March 2020, we have been developing a simplified mechanical lung  ventilator,  called  [MVM](http://mvm.care/)  (Mechanical  Ventilator  Milano),  to answer  the  high  request  of  ventilators  for  Acute  Respiratory Distress  Syndrome  (ARDS)  in  intensive  care  units.  The ventilator is now produced and certified for use in the EU, USA, and Canada. In this experience, which - software side - involved more  than  100  volunteer  researchers  towards  software certification at the extreme of their strength, we collected a set of lessons learned. 
From this experience, we have synthesised a set of guidelines that might help similar projects in the future.

In this page we collect all the material used in order to produce guiedlines for the development of a critical software under emergency:
- Lessons learned from the MVM project which have been proposed in our previous work: A. Bombarda et al., "Lessons Learned from the Development of a Mechanical Ventilator for COVID-19," 2021 IEEE 32nd International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE), 2021, pp. 24-35, doi: [10.1109/ISSRE52982.2021.00016](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9700322)
- Validation of lessons learned executed in the context of two courses for the Italian engineering society. 
- Guidelines
- Validation of guidelines via questionnaires and interviews
